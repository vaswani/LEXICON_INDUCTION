Pipeline - from data generation to results
------------------------------------------

Node: Data formats: 
if not mentioned otherwise, the format of all the data files is csv.
The function lex

* Data Preparation
To run the matching function, files need to be prepared
1) source language data - containing a graph on words and word features.
2) target language data - same as above.
3) bilexicon ground truth (i.e., dictionary) to compare results against.

To prepare the language data (1&2), use the script makeMat.m (in the scripts library)
or directly via the function in lexsyn2mat.m

its input is two pairs of file names, per each languageone for the language features, and another for the graph (e.g., synonym graph on the words).
the language feature file should be in the format


2. Matching - running GMCCA.run() and tuning hyperparamters.




Sanity Check
------------
The sanity check function in GMCCA first generates data according to
the generative story of matching CCA and then tries to recover it.

To run the sanity check in matlab, simply type in matlab

GMCCA.sanityCheck();

A correct output should look as follows:
